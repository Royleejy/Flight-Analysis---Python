# Flight Analysis 
This flight analysis project analysed flight data from Harvard dataverse, with the aim to answer the following questions:
1. What is the best time of day, time of month, time of year to fly to minimise delay
2. Do older planes suffer more delay?
3. How does the number of people travelling across location change over time?
4. Can we detect cascading failure as delays in one airport create delays in another?
5. Use the available variables to construct a model that predicts delays.


This simple project was conceived as coursework for one of my modules in UOL, done in both R and Python in R markdown and Jupyter notebook respectively.
